## 🧩 Workflow Overview

| Node | Type | Description |
|------|------|----------|
| **Google Sheets – Get Lead** | Google Sheets | Retrieves all rows from the **Lead Intake Sheet** containing columns such as `timestamp`, `name`, `email`, `company`, `budget`, `use_case`, `message`, and `processed`. |
| **Filter Unprocessed Leads** | Code Node | Filters only rows where `processed` is empty or not equal to `"yes"`. Prevents reprocessing already-handled leads. |
| **OpenAI – Analyze Lead** | OpenAI Chat Model | Analyzes each unprocessed lead and returns a **structured JSON** containing: `name`, `email`, `company`, `rowNumber`, `priority`, `summary`, and `personalized_email`. |
| **Parse OpenAI Response** | Code Node | Parses the JSON text from OpenAI and normalizes fields for use by downstream nodes (e.g., Gmail, Discord, and Google Sheets). |
| **Gmail – Send Reply** | Gmail | Sends the `personalized_email` generated by OpenAI directly to the lead’s `email` address with a predefined subject and professional message tone. |
| **Discord – Notify Lead** | HTTP Request | Posts a formatted message to a Discord channel via Webhook, containing the lead’s `name`, `email`, `company`, `priority`, and `summary`. |
| **Mark Lead as Processed** | Google Sheets | Updates the Google Sheet by setting the `processed` column to `"yes"` for the corresponding `rowNumber`, ensuring that the same lead isn’t reprocessed in future runs. |
